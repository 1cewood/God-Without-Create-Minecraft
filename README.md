# God-Without-Create 神不在的星期天
This is a Minecraft Modpacks.  
God Without Create is an integrated package of adventures based on mechanical power, HNN and deification. In this exciting adventure, adventurers not only need to explore relics and defeat bosses, but also build data models of various creatures to produce their dropped items, which form the main flow of the integrated pack. Through mechanical power, plant magic, and Paradox, players can produce many powerful items, including spellbooks and gems. In addition, in the process of exploration, the villagers will gradually begin to pay attention to the increasingly powerful adventurers. Players need to defend the village structure of Fanjia Monogom with puppets and defensive facilities of various materials, so as to purchase more powerful magic books and equipment from the villagers. As the player progresses through the adventure, many new forbidden secrets will be revealed to the player, and more and more deified bosses will become new obstacles -- or new opportunities -- to progress. The player can achieve sufficient strength in any or any of several lines of mechanical power, plant magic, and Paradox. The integration pack does not require players to force play any mod other than Deification, and important items in the main line have multiple alternative recipes based on different mods.  
The integration package features more than 1w lines of CrT script magic and pure hand-crafted packets by the author. The FTB quest line is basically complete.  
The integration package has an official server provided by the author.  
神不在的星期天是一个基于机械动力，HNN和神化的冒险向整合包。在这场激动人心的冒险中，冒险者不仅需要探索遗迹、战胜boss，还需要建立各种生物的数据模型来生产他们的掉落物品，这些物品构成了整合包的主线流程。通过机械动力、植物魔法和诡厄巫法，玩家可以生产包括附魔书和宝石在内的许多强大物品。除此之外，在探索过程中，灾厄村民会逐渐开始注意越发强大的冒险者。玩家需要配合各种材料的傀儡与防御设施保卫凡家物语的村庄结构，从而向村民购买更强大的附魔书与装备。随着玩家冒险的深入，许多新的禁忌秘法将展现在玩家面前，等级越来越高的神化BOSS也将成为前进道路上新的阻碍——或是新的机遇。玩家可以在机械动力，植物魔法，诡厄巫法中的任一或者任意多条线路中取得足够的强度。整合包不要求玩家强制游玩除了神化之外的任何一个mod，主线中的重要物品都有基于不同mod的多个替代配方。  
整合包具有超过1w行CrT脚本魔改和作者纯手工打造的数据包。FTB任务线基本完成。
